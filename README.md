# Creative Video Editor — Portfolio (local)

This is a simple, self-contained static portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates a dark, cinematic gradient theme, smooth reveal animations, project cards with modal video playback, a toolkit section, and a contact form stub.

How to run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser. On Windows, you can double-click the file or right-click -> Open with -> your browser.
2. For a local dev server (recommended for iframe autoplay reliability), run a static server. Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
# if you have Python 3 installed
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes and next steps:
- Replace placeholder images and video links with real assets.
- Hook the contact form to an email service or backend.
- Add optimized thumbnails and short muted previews for project cards for richer interactivity.
